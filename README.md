## Roadmap

Mesen-S is very early in its development and some features are still missing.  
The following should be added over time:

* Movies
* Netplay  
* Cheats  
* More debugging tools and improvements to the current tools
* Support for the enhancement chips used in some games
* Libretro core (once the emulation core is stable/accurate enough)
